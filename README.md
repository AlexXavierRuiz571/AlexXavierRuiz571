# 👋 Hi, I’m Alex Xavier Ruiz  
**Front-End Developer | Aspiring Full-Stack Engineer | TripleTen Software Engineering Student**

---

I’m a career-changer currently studying full-stack development through the TripleTen Software Engineering Program, with a strong focus on building clean, responsive, and accessible front-end interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My background in customer service taught me how to deliver real value, and now I apply that mindset to code. While I’m strongest in front-end development, I’m actively expanding into the back end with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to become a well-rounded full-stack engineer.
