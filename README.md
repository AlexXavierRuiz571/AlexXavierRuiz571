# 👋 Hi, I’m Alex Xavier Ruiz  
**Front-End Developer | Aspiring Full-Stack Engineer | TripleTen Software Engineering Student**

---

I’m a career-changer currently studying full-stack development through the TripleTen Software Engineering Program. I focus on building clean, responsive, and accessible front-end interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My background in customer service taught me how to deliver real value, and now I apply that mindset to code. While strongest in front-end, I’m actively expanding into back-end technologies like Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to become a well-rounded full-stack engineer.
