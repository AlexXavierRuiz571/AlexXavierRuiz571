# Hello, I’m Alex Xavier Ruiz  
**Junior Front-End Developer | Entry-level Full-Stack Javascript Engineer**

---

I am a junior software developer with a strong foundation in front-end development and hands-on experience building full-stack JavaScript applications.

My work focuses on clean UI structure, responsive layouts, and predictable application behavior. I value clear code, accessibility, and practical problem solving, and I approach projects with the goal of building features that make sense for real users.

I completed the TripleTen Software Engineering program, where I built and shipped multiple production-style projects involving responsive front-end development, API integration, and full-stack application flows. Through these projects, I strengthened my understanding of planning before coding, writing maintainable code, and documenting work clearly.

While my primary strength is front-end development, I am comfortable working across the stack and continue to grow my full-stack skill set through hands-on projects.
